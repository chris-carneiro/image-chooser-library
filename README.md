<h1> Notice </h1>
This library is a fork of Kumar Bibek's [image-chooser-library](https://github.com/coomar2841/image-chooser-library).<br/>
It is meant to be a lite version of the latter, meaning that several parts of the source code
were removed to make it lighter. <br/>
This library now supports picking and capturing of images 
ONLY!
Everything else has been taken out from the original project library</p>
